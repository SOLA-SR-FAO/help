    <title>Systematic Registration Record Objections</title>

  <body style=" margin-left: 24px; width: 1040px;">
    <h1>
       Record Objections
    </h1>
    <p>
       The lodging of an objection during public notification or the recording of a dispute against
      a systematic registration claim prior to that has the effect of preventing the associated
      Claim for Systematic Registration (ie the other service in the same application as the
      Dispute service) from being approved. Once an objection or dispute has been recorded against
      a claim, the claim cannot proceed unless the disputes service is cancelled (usually following
      some formal resolution process that could result in changes to the ownership rights and right
      holders)
    </p>
    <p>
       To record objection (including counter claims) details you will need to access the
      application recording the systematic registration details for that property. Select the
      application in the assigned or unassigned application lists on the Dashboard and choose Edit.
      If the application is not displayed in the application lists, use the Search Application
      screen to locate it and click the Edit button. This will open the Application Details screen
      allowing you to edit the application details and save changes&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       Once the dispute is resolved, the dispute service should be cancelled and this will allow
      the SR claim to proceed and be approved
    </p>
