    <h1>
       Record Objections
    </h1>
    <p>
       Objections to SR claims can be recorded once a SR Disputes form has been completed and
      signed by a person(s) disputing some part of a SR Claim that has been received. Typically
      objections are recorded during the public display period. To record an objection (dispute)
      the application of the original SR claim must be identified and a Disputes service added to
      the application. Start the Disputes service and the Disputes Form will be displayed and
      available to record details about the objection (dispute) and the person making the objection
    </p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       Once the dispute is resolved, the dispute service should be cancelled and this will allow
      the SR claim to proceed and be approved
