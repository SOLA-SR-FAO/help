       It is assumed that local government area (LGA) and ward boundaries have been loaded into
      SOLA as part of the SOLA setup for a SR project office and they are viewable as layers in the
      SOLA map. If that is not the case, a similar workflow should be followed as is described
      below before you define SR Daily Work Units and Public Display Areas.
    </p>
    <p class="msonormal">
       &nbsp;Likewise it is assumed that satellite imagery for the SR area has been made available
      to SOLA as another map layer through the publishing of the satellite imagery through a
      Geoserver setup on one of the SR desktop computers

    <h2>
       Create or Edit Daily Work Unit and Public Display area
    </h2>
    <h3>
       Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select the Spatial Unit Group Editor menu option from the main Systematic Registration menu
      </li>
      <li>
        Zoom in to the area to be defined as a SR Daily work Unit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select Daily Work Unit as the unit type from the dropdown list in the toolbar panel near
        the top of the screen
      </li>
      <li>
        Click on the <img src="../images/icons/polygon.png">&nbsp;toolbar icon to the right of unit
        type drop down list and trace the outline of the section boundary with left mouse clicks
        and a double click to close on the starting point. The new unit will be appear with a blue
        border .
      </li>
      <li>
        Click on the <img src="../images/icons/save.png">&nbsp;toolbar icon. The unit will
        disappear but can be returned by use of the <img src="../images/icons/pan.png"> toolbar
        icon. The new unit will now appear with a yellow border.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you need to make changes to existing Daily Work Units, use the <img src=
        "../images/icons/spatial-unit-group-select.png" width="16"> &nbsp;toolbar icon and select
        (with a very positive left mouse click) the section to be modified. Once you activated the
        edit mode, each node will appear as a red rectangle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click on the <img src="../images/icons/polygon.png"> &nbsp; toolbar icon and move the
        activated nodes to make the required modifications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Save <img src="../images/icons/save.png"> &nbsp;and use the scroll function to view the
        modified unit .
      </li>
      <li>
        Click on the Print button if you need to have a printed
      </li>
      <li>
        A pdf image of the map will be generated, based on what levels were displayed and the scale
        entered. This map can be printed or plotted directly from this display or saved for
        printing later
      </li>
      <li>
        Review the pdf file (from SOLA pdf Viewer) and modify the layout and scale to give the best
        result for the parcels to be publically displayed within the specified area
      </li>
      <li>
        Print the pdf file by clicking on Print icon <img src="../images/icons/print.png">&nbsp;in
        the in the toolbar of the SOLA pdf Viewer

    <h2>
       Merge spatial units of a lower level into one higher level unit
    </h2>
    <p>
       This feature is intended to allow the user to select several units of a lower level (e.g
      daily work unit) and create a single unit of the higher level(e.g. Public Display Area out of
      selected working units)
    </p>
    <h3>
       Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select higher level unit as the unit type (e.g. Public display area) from the dropdown list
        in the toolbar panel near the top of the screen
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <img src=
        "../images/icons/SpatialUnitGroupSelectSubHierarchy.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;tool and select the
        spatial units from a lower hierarchy level (e.g. Daily Work Unit). It means if Public
        Display Area is active, you can select spatial units from Daily Work Unit
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <img src="../images/icons/spatial-unit-group-merge.png">&nbsp;Merge tool: this
        merges all spatial units that are in the editing layer. In order to get a valid polygon, it
        is possible that next to the spatial units selected from the hierarchy below, to add also
        extra polygons that can fill the gaps
      </li>
      <li>
        When clicking merge, it is checked if the result geometry is a polygon. If&nbsp; it is not
        it will show a message to the user in order to go to hierarchy level below and&nbsp; change
        the polygons accordingly
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       By means of &nbsp;<img src="../images/icons/reset.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;reset&nbsp;icon you can
      always Reset all editing in the client not sent to the server yet.<br>
