    </h2>
    <p>
      <br>
       To record a new systematic registration Rights Claim (or Counter Claim), use the SOLA
      Desktop software and access the Application Details screen from the Applications &gt; New
      Applications menu or by selecting <img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/new.png" style=
      " margin-left: 20.0px;"><br>
       The initial details that need to be recorded are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        On the General tab for the new application form, in the Contact Details panel enter the
        claimant (or the person who is the contact person for the claimant or claimants) details
        including their first name, last name and address and contact details.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the Services tab, add a new service by double clicking on “Lodge SR Claim”&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        On the Property tab, click on the Search Parcel/UPIWard button enter the Parcel Number and
        select it from the search results list.
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        On the Documents tab, all documents such as the completed and signed claim form should be
        archived in SOLA already and your task is to link these scanned images to your application.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click on the <img src="../images/icons/add.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;toolbar icon (under the
        Documents tab)<span lang="EN-AU">. The Add Document form will open. </span>

      <li>
        <span lang="EN-AU">Click on the Document Search tab and enter the image references recorded
        on the SR form plus the scanned image of all SR forms associated with the SR claim using
        the New Document tab and accessing the scanned images in the ‘scanned’ sub-folder
        </span>Once the necessary information has been entered, save the application. This will
        lodge the application and assign an application number
      </li>
    </ul>

      <br>
    </p>
    <h2>
       Complete Claim Details
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br>
       To complete the entry of the claim details you will need to edit the application that
      initially recorded the claim. Select the application in the assigned or unassigned
      application lists on the Dashboard and choose Edit. If the application is not displayed in
      the application lists, use the Search Application screen to locate it and click the Edit
      button. This will open the Application Details screen allowing you to edit the application
      details and save changes.

      </li>
      <li>
        Open the assigned application and in the Documents tab identify the documents without a
        link to a scanned image. At the same time and additional supporting documents not captured
        at the time the claim was originally recorded should be entered and linked to the scanned
        images of these supporting documents
      </li>
      <li>
        Click on the Document Search toolbar icon and search for the documents without linked
        imaged identified at the previous step. Select the document record, click on the <img src=

      <li>
        Start the Systematic Registration Claim service
      </li>
      <li>
