       Rights Claim
    </h1>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2>
       Initially Record a New Rights Claim
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br>
       To record a new systematic registration Rights Claim (or Counter Claim), use the SOLA
      Desktop software and access the Application Details screen from the Applications &gt; New
      Applications menu or by selecting <img alt="" src="../images/addSource.png" style=
      " width: 20px; height: 20px;"><br>
       The initial details that need to be recorded are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        On the General tab for the new application form, in the Contact Details panel enter the
        claimant (or the person who is the contact person for the claimant or claimants) details
        including their first name, last name and address and contact details
      </li>
      <li>
        On the Services tab, add a new service by double clicking on “Lodge SR Claim”
      </li>
      <li>
        On the Property tab, enter the Parcel Number (in the Parcel Number field), StateLga?Ward
        name (in the Upi Ward Code field) and the land use
      </li>
      <li>
        On the Documents tab, all documents such as the completed and signed claim form should be
        recorded (but there is no need to link the scanned image of the documents unless it is
        convenient to do so)
      </li>
      <li>
        On the Fees tab, click on the Calculate Fees toolbar icon and record invoice number, amount
        paid and click on the Fees Paid radio button
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the necessary information has been entered, save the application. This will lodge the
        application, assign an application number and display the Lodgement Notice for your review.
        You can choose to print (or save the Lodgement Notice and record and link it from the
        Documents tab)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h2>
       Complete Claim Details
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br>
       To complete the entry of the claim details you will need to edit the application that
      initially recorded the claim. Select the application in the assigned or unassigned
      application lists on the Dashboard and choose Edit. If the application is not displayed in
      the application lists, use the Search Application screen to locate it and click the Edit
      button. This will open the Application Details screen allowing you to edit the application
      details and save changes.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open the application and check the Fee paid flag on the Fees tab
      </li>
      <li>
        Assign the application with the Systematic Registration service to yourself
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the assigned application and in the Documents tab identify the documents without a
        link to a scanned image. At the same time and additional supporting documents not captured
        at the time the claim was originally recorded should be entered and linked to the scanned
        images of these supporting documents
      </li>
      <li>
        Click on the Document Search toolbar icon and search for the documents without linked
        imaged identified at the previous step. Select the document record, click on the <img alt=
        "" src="../images/07_edit_icon.png" style=" width: 50px; height: 20px;"> icon and add the
        link for the scanned document
      </li>
      <li>
        Start the Systematic Registration Claim service
      </li>
      <li>
        SOLA will open the Property Details screen with the property reference for the new property
        already set. Verify this matches the claim form. If the property reference is not correct,
        close the Property Details screen without saving and remove the property details on the
        Property tab of the Application Details screen, save the application and click on <img alt=
        "" src="../images/start_again_icon.png" style=" width: 20px; height: 20px;"> to start the
        service again
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        Use the Search parcel text field to check if a parcel matching the title reference exists
        in SOLA. If it does, click the result in the results list then click the Select button.
        Leave this form blank and return to it in another session, when the survey data has been
