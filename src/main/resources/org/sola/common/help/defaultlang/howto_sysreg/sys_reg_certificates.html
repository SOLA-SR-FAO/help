    <h1>
       Generate Registration Certificates and Parcel Plans
    </h1>
    <h2>
       Bulk generation
    </h2>
    <p>
       This functionality allows you to print registration certificates or Plans&nbsp;for all
      parcels within a work unit&nbsp;of a systematic registration area where the claim for
      systematic registration has been upheld and the claim application approved
    </p>
    <h3>
       Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        From the Dashboard form on the main menu bar click on the Systematic Registration –
        Certificate (or Parcel Plans) menu option.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enter the name of the Work Unit&nbsp;in the Location field. As you type it, the names of
        the units subject to systematic registration will appear in a list below in a “google
        search” like fashion. When the name of the Work Unit&nbsp;that you need to create a public
        notification listing appears in that list then select that row and click on the View
        button.
      </li>
      <li>
        The certificates are stored in the SOLA digital archive and can be retrieved by a regular
        Document search using the new certificate of occupancy reference
        (beingTOTAL_&lt;&lt;Ward/LGA/State&gt;&gt; as the reference number and Certificate of
        Occupancy as document type
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
       Single certificate&nbsp;generation
    </h2>
    <p>
       This functionality allows you to print certificates of occupancy for a single parcel if the
      claim application &nbsp;had been approved
    </p>
    <h3>
       Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        From the Dashboard form select and open the Application for the parcel you want to generate
        the certificate for
      </li>
      <li>
        Click on the <img src="../images/icons/approve1.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate icon&nbsp; in
        the Application Form to generate the Certificate or on the <img src=
        "../images/icons/document-task.png"> &nbsp;Plan icon to generate the Parcel Plan
      </li>
      <li>
        The certificate (or the Plan)&nbsp;will be visualized and stored in the SOLA digital
        archive and can be retrieved by a regular Document search using the new certificate of
        occupancy reference (being &lt;&lt;UPI Parcel Number&gt;&gt;_&lt;&lt;Ward/LGA/State&gt;&gt;
        as the reference number and Certificate of Occupancy as document type.
