        <h1>Bulk Load Scanned Documents</h1>

        <p> This functions allows the loading of existing scanned documents 
            (for instance sporadic registration documents) into the SOLA digital archive 
            and hence provide easy access to these documents by the systematic registration team.
        </p>

        <h2>Load Scanned Document Collections</h2>
        This step should ideally occur at the start-up stage of systematic registration. 
        Scanned document images will need to be loaded onto the workstation to do the uploading
        or a network folder accessible by the SOLA user. Each collection should be in a folder that 
        corresponds to a document type (source.administrative_source_type table in SOLA database)

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <br>In this part of the screen, the destination type is defined. At the moment, there are two:
        <ol>
            <li>Run the SOLA Bulk Operations software</li>
            <li>From the Dashboard select the Load Scanned Documents tool to open the Load Scanned Documents 
                screen
            </li>    
            <li>Identify the folder in which there are a series of subfolders containing a particular collection for 
                a document type (eg a subfolder named “mortgage” for scanned images of mortgages. Another sub-folder
                named “lease” etc ). You should select the head folder containing the sub-folders and Files of Type
                drop-down should remain expression as Directories Only
            </li>
            <li>Click on Load and message Information Source are loaded with success. The files of type drop down 
                should retain the Directories Only  as the value for the Files of Type. Sub-folder name must 
                coincide with a document type as recorded in the source.administrative_source_type table in the 
                SOLA database. Scanned image files must be .pdf, .tif, .tiff or jpg. If any of these conditions 
                are not met a message will be displayed and you will be directed to the Validation Screen 
                (by clicking on the Validation button) for details on the where those conditions are not met
                <br>

            </li>
            <li>Other object
                This is selected if you want to upload other kinds of objects like road, control points, villages, etc.
                Further, input the type of the object and which field in the source will be used for the label.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
